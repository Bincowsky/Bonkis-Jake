### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

#### **1. Data Preprocessing and Exploration**

**a. Data Cleaning**

- **Handle Missing Values:**
  - Replace placeholder values like `-1.0` with `NaN` for clarity.
  - Decide on an imputation strategy (e.g., median imputation, regression imputation) for each variable based on its nature and the extent of missingness.

- **Outlier Detection and Treatment:**
  - Use statistical methods (e.g., Z-scores, IQR) to identify outliers.
  - Investigate outliers to determine if they are data errors or legitimate extreme values.
  - Apply transformations or cap values as appropriate.

**b. Data Exploration**

- **Univariate Analysis:**
  - Examine distributions of numerical variables.
  - Identify any skewness or kurtosis that may affect modeling.

- **Bivariate Analysis:**
  - Explore relationships between features and the target variable.

  - Plot sales over time for different brands and countries.
  - Identify trends, seasonality, and patterns.

- **Categorical Variable Analysis:**
  - Analyze the frequency and distribution of categorical variables.
  - Consider the levels of each category and whether grouping is necessary.

#### **2. Domain-Specific Feature Engineering**

**a. Market Potential Estimation**

- **Total Addressable Market (TAM):**
  - Calculate `TAM = population * prev_perc`.
  - If `market_share_estimate` is available or can be estimated from similar drugs, include it: `TAM = population * prev_perc * market_share_estimate`.

- **Adjust for Country-Specific Factors:**
  - Incorporate `public_perc_che` and `insurance_perc_che` to adjust TAM based on healthcare coverage.

**b. Adoption Curves and Sales Dynamics**

- **Time Since Launch:**
  - Calculate the number of months since the drug's launch for each data point.
  - Include this as a feature to model growth phases.

- **Growth Rate Indicators:**
  - Compute features like cumulative sales or moving averages.

- **Lagged Features:**
  - Create lagged versions of sales and other time-dependent variables.

**c. Pricing and Economic Factors**

- **Price Elasticity:**
  - Calculate relative pricing metrics compared to competitors or average market prices.

- **Economic Indicators:**
  - Use `che_pc_usd`, `che_perc_gdp` to reflect economic conditions.
  - Consider normalizing these features.

**d. Therapeutic Area and Indication Features**

- **One-Hot Encoding or Embeddings:**
  - For categorical variables like `therapeutic_area` and `indication`, consider using embeddings, especially if integrating with the GNN.

- **Polynomial Features:**
  - If appropriate, include polynomial terms to capture non-linear relationships.

#### **3. Graph Construction and GNN Training**

**a. Graph Construction**

- **Define Nodes:**
  - Nodes represent entities such as drugs (`drug_id`), brands (`brand`), corporations (`corporation`), countries (`country`), indications (`indication`), and therapeutic areas (`therapeutic_area`).

- **Define Edges:**
  - Edges represent relationships between entities:
    - Drug-to-Indication: A drug treats an indication.
    - Brand-to-Drug: A brand is associated with a drug.
    - Brand-to-Country: A brand is sold in a country.
    - Corporation-to-Brand: A corporation owns a brand.
    - Indication-to-Therapeutic Area: An indication belongs to a therapeutic area.

**b. Assign Features**

- **Node Features:**
  - Assign attributes to nodes, such as `price_unit`, `prev_perc`, `public_perc_che`, and embeddings of categorical variables.

- **Edge Features:**
  - If applicable, include edge attributes like the strength of relationships or co-occurrence frequencies.

**c. GNN Training**

- **Choose a GNN Architecture:**
  - Start with a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) or GraphSAGE for simplicity.
  - Consider Graph Attention Networks (GAT) if you want the model to learn the importance of different neighbors.

- **Training Setup:**
  - **Objective:** Learn node embeddings that capture relational information.
  - **Loss Function:** Depending on the task, use unsupervised methods like node embedding learning or supervised methods if you have labels.

#### **4. Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling**

**a. Define the Hierarchical Structure**

- **Levels of Hierarchy:**
  - **Level 1:** Global effects (overall mean sales).
  - **Level 2:** Country-level effects.
  - **Level 3:** Brand-level effects within countries.
  - **Level 4:** Time-level effects (months since launch).

- **Model Specification:**
  - Define a Bayesian regression model where the target variable is modeled as a function of predictors at each hierarchical level.

**b. Incorporate Features**

- **Include Engineered Features:**
  - Use features from step 2 as covariates in the model.

- **Include GNN Embeddings:**
  - Add embeddings from the GNN as additional covariates.

**c. Set Priors**

  - For example, use historical average sales as a prior for the intercept.

- **Hyperpriors:**
  - For group-level variances, use weakly informative priors.

**d. Model Implementation**

- **Choose a Bayesian Framework:**
  - Use PyMC3 (Python) or Stan (R/Python) for model implementation.

#### **5. Model Integration and Prediction**

**a. Combine Models**

- **Integrated Model:**
  - The hierarchical Bayesian model should include GNN embeddings as features.

  - If using attention mechanisms, visualize attention weights to show influential relationships.

**c. Communicating Results**

- **Business Language:**
  - Translate technical findings into business insights.
  - Emphasize how factors like pricing, market potential, and healthcare expenditure impact sales.

- **Actionable Recommendations:**
  - Suggest strategies based on model results (e.g., targeting specific markets).
